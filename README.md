  In this web-based game, players are tasked with accurately guessing the age of a depicted individual within a specified number of attempts. Following each win or loss, players must reset the game. Additionally, they retain the option to reset the game at their discretion. Notably, with each game reset, the age and birth year of the depicted individual undergo dynamic changes. Upon successfully guessing the age, players are rewarded with a name and a descriptive paragraph either about the current individual in the picture or a person associated with it.
